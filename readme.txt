    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This project displays 2 clocks. one 24 hours and one 12 hours and gives the user the chance to program the clock down to the second
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    I did a good job using a second thread to refresh the screen to update the time live
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I could enhance this code by making the screen refresh less jarring
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    Both the multi-threaded approach I took and getting a live time from the system were equally challenging, I can thank stack overflow for the help with that.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    I can see the multi-threading being transferable, as well as the familiarity with the ctime library
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    By using OOP principles and keeping most important funcatioanlity in either function or the clock class, as well as writing my code using the 
    proper sytle conevetions and in-line comments where functionality isn't clear.
